A good README should include a brief overview section with a paragraph or two explaining what the software does, how it works, and who made it.

# Project Overview

The Stuffy Study investigates the ventilation and learning environment in student study spaces using real-time environmental sensing and interactive data visualisation.

This repository contains:

* SOMETHING ABOUT DATA COLLECTION

* SOMETHING ABOUT DATA COLLECTION #2

* a Streamlit dashboard for data exploration, cleaning, visualisation, and reporting

* a modular Python architecture separating data handling, plotting, theming, reporting, and reference information

* support for live sensor data, uploaded CSV datasets, and simulated fallback data

The dashboard is designed to be robust, reproducible, and extendable, following best practice in scientific data workflows.




Dashboard: 

1. Ensure you are running your dashboard code in the correct file directory

You can do this by selecting 'Copy Relative Path' of the dashboard file and deleting the file from the end.

     cd "Your path directory"

Followed by 

streamlit run "dashboard.py"

This will take you to a localhost:8501 link where you can open your dashboard. 

2. When downloaded, ensure the config.toml file is in a separate folder named '.steamlit' in the same directory as the dashboard.
